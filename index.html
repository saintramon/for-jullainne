        <h1>My Jullainne, </h1>
        <p>
            The concept of parallel universe still baffles me. The possibility that in another universe I'm not pursuing Computer Science, that in another universe I'm not studying at SLU, that in another universe I may have not met you.
        </p>
        <p>
            What are the chances and probability that in this universe, this version of Ramon is able to experience the privilege of being yours would do. It must have been calculated will from a higher being. Or am I wrong? 
        </p>
        <p>
            I wonder what the other Ramons are up to right now. Are they receiving lengthy messages on how Jullaine's day went? Are they able to hear Jullainne's laugh? Are they able to witness the long lashes of Jullainne? How unlucky the Ramons from other universes. They will not be able to experience the love that the Ramon from this universe is receiving. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Is this luck? a mere coincidence? or it's really a universe where a version of Ramon is meant to love a version of Jullainne.
        </p>

            As you're reading this letter, it might not have sinked in a 100%. But don't worry, as good things are meant to be absorbed slowly.

            Jullainne it has been 32 days. 32 days since we agreed upon something that both you and I can only understand. 32 days since the sounds of a particular typewriter began to click. 32 days since the ink of a pen began to stroke in a piece of paper. It still feels surreal. A feeling I cannot really describe.
        </p>
        <p>
            A month has passed, but I still haven't been able to uncover and decipher some of you. I still haven't discovered the hidden depths. I still haven't seen all your roots. I don't really understand you sometimes Jullainne, but you know that I tend to like more the things that I cannot really comprehend. Hindi ko pa alam lahat ng ikaw, pero lahat ng alam ko, mahal ko na.
